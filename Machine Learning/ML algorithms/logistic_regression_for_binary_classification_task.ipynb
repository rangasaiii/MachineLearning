        "Logisitc Regression is commonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. If the estimated probability that an instance is greater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class 1, or else it predicts that it does not. This makes it a binary classifier. In this notebook we will look at the theory behind `Logistic Regression`  and use it to indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.\n",

        "- **Binary Output Variable:** This might be obvious as we have already mentioned it, but logistic regression is intended for binary (two-class) classification problems. It will predict the probability of an instance belonging to the default class, which can be snapped into a 0 or 1 classification.\n",
        "- **Remove Noise:** Logistic regression assumes no error in the output variable (y), consider removing outliers and possibly misclassified instances from your training data.\n",
        "- **Gaussian Distribution:** Logistic regression is a linear algorithm (with a non-linear transform on output). It does assume a linear relationship between the input variables with the output. Data transforms of your input variables that better expose this linear relationship can result in a more accurate model. For example, you can use log, root, Box-Cox and other univariate transforms to better expose this relationship.\n",

        "- What the logistic function is and how it is used in logistic regression.\n",
        "- That the key representation in logistic regression are the coefficients, just like linear regression.\n",
        "- That the coefficients in logistic regression are estimated using a process called maximum-likelihood estimation.\n",
        "- That making predictions using logistic regression is so easy that you can do it in excel.\n",
        "- That the data preparation for logistic regression is much like linear regression.\n",
